# Community-run virtual events
This year the .NET Foundation is supporting community-run virtual events to help spread the word about the .NET 5.0 release. This repo contains creative and technical content for running a .NET Conf 2020 virtual event for your community. 

**If you are interested in running a virtual meetup or event for your community between November 13, 2020 and January 31, 2021, please make sure you let us know by filling out the [Virtual Community Event Request Form](https://bit.ly/3mR1lsA).** We will advertize your community event on the main event website, YouTube and social. 

# Event Guidelines
You are free to organize a presentation, workshop, or hack-a-thon delivered virtually, anytime after the main event broadcast until January 31, 2021. 

The technical content needs to be .NET related and preferably on .NET 5.0. Topics can include but aren't limited to: ASP.NET, Xamarin, Unity, Windows, Visual Studio family, C#/F#/Visual Basic, Azure, ML .NET, Entity Framework, .NET open source projects. Basically, anything .NET-related! You can also choose to redeliver any of the content from the show, with proper attribution to the original speakers. 

# Technical Content
Session decks will be found in the `Technical` folder as we receive them from speakers. Watch the sessions on demand on the [.NET YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVWop1HEOml2OdqbDs6IlcI) and [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2020/).

# Creative & Social Copy 
The `Creative` folder contains creative banners and images you can use to advertise .NET Conf and your own community events. There are a variety of sizes to choose from. You may use any of these banners to advertize the main event itself, or your virtual events in your community. You may add your local meetup name, location and dates to these images. Please do not change the .NET Conf branding. Please contact [dotnetconf@dotnetfoundation.org](mailto:dotnetconf@dotnetfoundation.org) if you have any questions.
