## Thank you!

A huge **THANK YOU** to all who tuned in live, asked questions, and participated in our twitter feed. We had awesome sessions from various experts that showed us the power of Xamarin and .NET! 

*.NET Conf: Focus on Xamarin* is a free, one-day livestream event that features speakers from the community and .NET product teams that are working on building native mobile apps with Xamarin technology! Xamarin lets you build native mobile apps for Android and iOS with C# instead of Java and Swift.
