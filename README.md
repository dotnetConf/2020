Check out the [`MainEvent`](MainEvent) folder for Creative and Technical content related to the big, three day event where we launch .NET 5.0! 

In January we also started a series of smaller, one-day, live events that we deliver to you throughout the year that are focused on specific things you can do with .NET. 

Check out the `FocusOn...` folders for content related to those and get more info on the website [focus.dotnetconf.net](http://focus.dotnetconf.net) for the next one.
