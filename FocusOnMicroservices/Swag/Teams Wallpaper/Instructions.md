# Here is where you go to add the images to your teams background

### On a Windows PC, backgrounds are downloaded by the Teams client and stored within %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Teams\Backgrounds\Uploads.

### On a macOS, backgrounds are stored within the Microsoft Teams client folder ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams/Backgrounds/Uploads.
To get to that folder, simply type Command+Shift+G from the Mac OS X desktop or a Finder window.
